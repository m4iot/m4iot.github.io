<h2>Program of the IoT Federated Workshops: M4IoT & MECC</h2>

<h4>Monday, December 11th 2016</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>9:00 - Introduction, and keynote by Dr. Douglas C. Schmidt (Vanderbilt University)</strong><br>
    Topic: <em>The Blockchain: What It is and Why It Matters for Us</em><br>
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Since the inception of Bitcoin technology, its underlying data
    structure--the blockchain--has garnered much attention due its key
    properties, such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability.
    These properties make blockchains suitable for decentralized apps
    (DApps) that require trustless exchange, consistent and incorruptible
    transaction records, as well as enables operational use cases beyond
    cryptocurrencies.  For example, blockchain has the potential to
    address interoperability challenges in a number of domains--including
    IoT domains--such as delivering patient data securely to healthcare
    organizations and devices, improving the overall efficiency of energy
    transactions in electrical power distribution systems, and enabling
    effective interactions between commuters and transit apps in smart
    cities.  Despite the interest in using blockchain technology for
    interoperability, however, little information is available on the
    concrete architectural styles and recommendations for designing
    middleware in support of blockchain-based DApps for IoT systems.  This
    talk discusses key concepts in blockchains and important design,
    privacy, and security considerations when considering using their use
    in practice.
