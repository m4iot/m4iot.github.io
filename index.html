    <p>
      The Internet of Things (IoT) is creating new services and applications across various domains, including smart grids, intelligent transportation, healthcare, smart homes, and energy management. As a consequence, a complex ecosystem of interconnected applications, services, as well as physical and virtual devices emerges. In this ecosystem, enabled by corresponding middleware, devices share contextual data or receive control commands; services consume, process, and/or provide data; and applications leverage services and devices to fulfill users’ needs. This workshop focuses on two fundamental components in such ecosystems: the middleware that enables composition of applications, services, and devices; and the applications built on top of such middleware. Central topics of interest include the architecture of these components, how they process data, how they communicate with one another, and the process of how they are designed, implemented, and operated.

        <strong>8:30 - Introduction M4IoT and keynote by Dr. Douglas C. Schmidt (Vanderbilt University)</strong><br>
        Topic: <em>The Blockchain: What It is and Why It Matters for Us</em><br>
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Since the inception of Bitcoin technology, its underlying data
        structure--the blockchain--has garnered much attention due its key
        properties, such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability.
        These properties make blockchains suitable for decentralized apps
        (DApps) that require trustless exchange, consistent and incorruptible
        transaction records, as well as enables operational use cases beyond
        cryptocurrencies.  For example, blockchain has the potential to
        address interoperability challenges in a number of domains--including
        IoT domains--such as delivering patient data securely to healthcare
        organizations and devices, improving the overall efficiency of energy
        transactions in electrical power distribution systems, and enabling
        effective interactions between commuters and transit apps in smart
        cities.  Despite the interest in using blockchain technology for
        interoperability, however, little information is available on the
        concrete architectural styles and recommendations for designing
        middleware in support of blockchain-based DApps for IoT systems.  This
        talk discusses key concepts in blockchains and important design,
        privacy, and security considerations when considering using their use
        in practice.

        <strong>13:30 - Introduction MECC and Keynote by Prof. Paulo Ferreira (INESC-ID, IST)</strong><br>
        Topic: <em>Live Migration and Garbage Collection for Big Data Java Applications</em><br>
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The need to process large amounts of data, Big Data, is a
        reality, and ranges from scientific experiments to social networks.
        Big Data means processing and storing massive amounts of data in a
        efficient way, possibly on the cloud or on cloudlets. With easy and
        fast development cycles, managed object-oriented programming languages
        (such as Java) are now preferred languages to implement most Big Data
        platforms. With the increasing importance of Big Data, we identify two
        main requirements that are common to most platforms running on any
        tier of modern cloud computing platforms: i) the ability to tolerate
        faults and to adapt to the number of nodes to satisfy new workload
        requirements, and ii) the ability to scale with the amount of local
        resources. In this talk, we address two solutions to deal with the
        above requirements: i) JLM, live migration of running Java
        applications, and ii) NG2C, an N-generational Garbage Collection (GC)
        algorithm. Both solutions improve Big Data platforms performance by
        decreasing the number of objects to copy between physical nodes (for
        migration) and heap generations (for GC). With JLM and NG2C, both
        latency and throughput is improved for Big Data applications when a
        migration or a GC takes place, thus increasing applications performance.
